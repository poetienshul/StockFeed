On Tuesday, Heiko Maas, Germany’s minister of justice and consumer protection, said he would propose a law that would impose stiff fines on companies whose social media platforms did not respond swiftly enough to complaints about illegal content. Mr. Maas has been a vocal critic of how companies treat online content that violates the country’s strict rules on hate speech.

If the law is approved, tech companies may face fines of up to 50 million euros, or $53 million, for not combating hate speech, potentially the highest such penalty in the Western world.

It calls for “obviously criminal content” to be deleted or blocked within 24 hours, while companies would have seven days to remove posts that are less clear-cut.

Photo The yearlong study noted that while the two companies eventually erased nearly all illegal hate speech, in January and February, Facebook managed to delete 39 percent in the time frame sought by the German authorities and Twitter 1 percent. Google’s YouTube video service fared the best, taking down within 24 hours 90 percent of all content flagged.

Q. When I get the notice of a software update for iOS, there’s usually a link to read about the security content of the update. But where does Apple officially tell you about all other things that change in these upgrades? A. You can see a list of the new features, added apps, bug fixes and other tweaks Apple has made to each version of its iOS mobile operating system by visiting the iOS Downloads page in the support area of the company’s site. On the iOS Downloads page, click the link for the version of the system you are using on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch to see the scope of the changes (like “new emoji” or “transit directions for Japan”) noted in a series of bullet points. Photo Each version of the system shown on the iOS Downloads page should also display that same link to the update’s security-related information that you see when you use the Software Update setting on your iOS device. The Apple Security Updates page on the company’s site has those details, along with the documentation for all of Apple’s software products like macOS and its various programs, tools for developers and the operating systems for the Apple Watch and Apple TV. Google posts information about Android news and updates on the Android section of its company blog and in its monthly Android Security Bulletins. While intended for app creators, the Android Developers site also outlines the new features of each new version of the operating system. As the Android software is widely used by several hardware manufacturers and wireless carriers, those companies may have their own list of updates too. Microsoft’s site has a general guide to the new features in the latest Windows 10 Mobile operating system, as well as regular blog posts. The mobile-devices support area of the site lists the update history for the various Lumia models that run the Windows software for phones. While not official sources of documentation, many blogs and online forums dedicated to operating systems also offer in-depth reviews of software updates and often do a thorough job of laying out the good, the bad and the buggy changes. Links to a selection of popular Apple-themed blogs can be found here, but Android blogs and those devoted to Microsoft’s offerings (like MSPoweruser, Windows Central and Thurrott) have sections devoted to Windows mobile matters. 




Photo Apple is losing its grip on American classrooms, which technology companies have long used to hook students on their brands for life. Over the last three years, Apple’s iPads and Mac notebooks — which accounted for about half of the mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States in 2013 — have steadily lost ground to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on Google’s Chrome operating system and are produced by Samsung, Acer and other computer makers. Mobile devices that run on Apple’s iOS and MacOS operating systems have now reached a new low, falling to third place behind both Google-powered laptops and Microsoft Windows devices, according to a report released on Thursday by Futuresource Consulting, a research company. Devices Shipped to Schools The number of laptops, tablets and other mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States, by company-specific operating system. million 8 6 4 2 0 Google Apple Microsoft 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States in 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, up from 50 percent in 2015, according to the report. School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said. “Apple is struggling,” said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource. Apple said education was a longstanding value for the company.

The rise of Google’s Chromebooks has disrupted the momentum of Apple, which has been marketing its computers to schools for some 40 years. Apple has recently widened its education offerings. Last year, it introduced an app, called Classroom, to help teachers see and manage their students’ activities on iPads. It also created a free iPad app, called Swift Playgrounds, that introduces students to writing computer code. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The shift toward Google-powered devices is hurting Apple’s revenue. Of the $7.35 billion that schools, colleges and universities spent on mobile and desktop computers in 2016, sales of Apple devices fell to $2.8 billion in 2016, from about $3.2 billion in 2015, according to IDC, a market research firm. Windows devices generated $2.5 billion in 2016, up from $2.1 billion in 2015, while Chrome devices reached $1.9 billion, up from $1.4 billion. The Chromebook has beaten out classroom competitors on pricing, usability and other factors. Chromebooks run apps through Google’s cloud-based Chrome operating system, making them cheaper — and often faster to boot up — than traditional laptops that rely on hard drives. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Because Chromebooks store documents in the cloud, they can be shared among students, who can grab any school device to access their class work. Google also provides school administrators with an online dashboard to remotely manage thousands of the laptops at once. Photo Then there is the keyboard issue. While school administrators generally like the iPad’s touch screens for younger elementary school students, some said older students often needed laptops with built-in physical keyboards for writing and taking state assessment tests. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The public school system in Eudora, Kan., for instance, used to have rolling carts of iPads for elementary school classrooms and MacBook carts for older students to share. But last year, when administrators wanted to provide a laptop for each high school student, the district bought 500 Chromebooks at about $230 each. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “At the end of the day, I can get three Chromebooks for each of the Mac devices I would have purchased,” said Steve Splichal, the superintendent of Eudora Public Schools. He added that Eudora students continued to use MacBooks for certain creative courses and that first graders and younger students still used iPads. To compete with Chromebooks, Microsoft announced last month that it had worked with Acer, HP and Lenovo to develop low-cost Windows laptops for schools, with prices starting at $189. The company also introduced an app, called Microsoft Intune for Education, to enable schools to more easily set up and manage their Windows devices.

In particular, Mr. Assange said his anti-secrecy organization would let the tech companies view unpublished technical details about what needs to be repaired, write Scott Shane, David Sanger and Vindu Goel.

Q. When will the next version of Android be released and what might be in it? A. Google released Android O, the “developer’s preview” of the next version, on March 21 so app developers could begin working with the future operating system. The final public release of the software and its delivery to smartphones and tablets is likely to take place this year, but a lot of work will happen in the meantime as the system is tested and refined. Photo Some of the new features expected in Android O include improved support for using the keyboard to navigate Android apps, better control of onscreen notifications and picture-in-picture video so people can continue to play clips while tapping into other apps. Also in the pipeline are improved audio fidelity over Bluetooth connections and support for Wi-Fi Aware technology (which allows compatible devices to connect directly to each other without a cellular data or other wireless network). Android O will be a work in progress for several months, but Google says it will do a “deep dive on all things Android” at its annual Google I/O conference that starts May 17. These developer-oriented events are often used by companies to showcase new software on the way. Microsoft’s Build conference for Windows software creators starts on May 10, and Apple’s World Wide Developers Conference for its operating systems will take place the first week of June. The release date and the official name of Android O will be revealed later in the year as development of the system continues. The company should also announce which hardware models will get the update. In recent years, Google has released the final versions of Android in late summer (as with Android 7.0 Nougat, on Aug. 22, 2016) and even deep into autumn (Android 4.0 Kit Kat arrived on Oct. 31, 2013), but the day you actually get the new version depends on your device and wireless carrier. 




Q. I had Google Chrome for Windows set so web pages couldn’t start playing videos, but I have noticed over the past few months that the clips play anyway. I didn’t change any of the browser settings, so what happened? A. You may not have changed the browser’s settings, but the websites you use may have changed the way they handle video. For years, many sites used additional plug-in software like Adobe Flash to show videos — and most web browsers had settings to stop the plug-in software from automatically playing the clips when the page loaded. Photo However, many sites have gradually switched from using the video plug-in software and are now using HTML5, which is a language for creating web pages that embeds the clips in the page. Because the plug-in software you are blocking in the browser settings no longer controls the video, the clip often starts rolling when the page loads. While most browsers do not include easily reached settings to stop the autoplay videos, you do have some workarounds. For Google Chrome, one option is to go to the online Chrome Web Store and search for the free Disable HTML5 Autoplay extension. Once you install the extension, it should prevent audio and video clips on web pages from playing automatically. You can turn the extension off or on from its icon in the Chrome toolbar. A version of the Disable HMTL5 Autoplay extension is also available for those using the Opera browser. 




Photo Google moved on Tuesday to protect its lucrative advertising business by giving marketers greater control over where their ads appear online, after major clients withdrew spots that were shown next to hate speech and other offensive material. Google has become a global advertising behemoth, pocketing billions of dollars every year from brands promoting their goods through the company’s search engine and on YouTube. But the changes, which will be introduced in the coming weeks, highlight the difficult balance between protecting Google’s advertising business while also allowing free speech. By giving brands more say over where their ads appear, experts say, Google is acknowledging that it has not done enough so far to police the material on its sites. “Recently, we had a number of cases where brands’ ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. “We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us.” Google’s efforts to improve its policies show how dependent it remains on online advertising, despite the large bets its parent company, Alphabet, has made on other technologies, like driverless cars and health care. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Last year, Alphabet made $19.5 billion in net profit, a 23 percent annual jump, almost all of which was generated from Google’s advertising business. Google’s public mea culpa follows the pulling of ads by Havas, a French advertising multinational. Havas withdrew spots for several of its clients from the search giant’s digital services in Britain after failing to receive assurances that they would not be shown next to offensive material. As part of the advertising revamp, Google said that it would rigorously vet online content that could be considered hate speech or derogatory content. That would include giving brands greater say over where their ads would be shown online, and powers to remove them if companies were still not satisfied.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story In a recent study in Germany, the company was found to have removed 90 percent of posts flagged as potential hate speech after it had been reported. That figure was markedly higher than those of Facebook and Twitter. Google’s stance has come under increased scrutiny in recent months with the rise of so-called fake news and with hate speech connected to elections in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Some freedom of speech campaigners have urged Google to stand its ground, but policy makers around the world have called on the company to do more to combat the spread of offensive material on the internet. 




Q. I missed switching over to the new version of Google that separates different categories of messages. Is it too late to get set up like that? The number of emails I get is overwhelming. A. Even if you declined Google’s invitation to revamp your Gmail mailbox structure with the company’s “priority inbox” system when the pop-up offer occurred, you can change your mind. Just log into your Gmail account on the web, click on the gear-shaped Settings icon on the right side of the window and select Configure Inbox from the menu. In the Configure Inbox screen, you can enable up to five tabs that automatically sort incoming mail into separate categories: Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates and Forums. Once you have selected your preferred tabs, click the Save button in the box. Photo Gmail classifies Primary messages as one-to-one conversations with correspondents that do not fall into another category, like Facebook updates. Facebook updates themselves traditionally get sorted into the Social tab, which also collects automatic email notifications from LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube and other social-networking sites. The Promotions tab is where marketing messages, special offers, sale announcements and other deal advertisements are grouped. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mail containing reservations, confirmations, bills, account statements and other automatically generated transaction messages fall under the Updates tab in the full Gmail Priority Inbox setup. If you choose to show the Forums tab, click it to see messages from mailing lists, discussion forums and other online groups with which you engage. Gmail Priority Inbox has been around in some form since 2010. In addition to dividing your mailbox into tidy categories, you can have Gmail add “importance markers” — little attention-getting yellow flags next to the names of frequent correspondents — to incoming messages. To do so, click on the gear-shaped Settings icon in the mail Gmail window, choose Settings and then the Inbox tab. On the next screen, click the button next to Importance Markers and decide if you want Google to use your past interactions to determine who earns an importance marker. Click the Save Changes button when you are finished. 




Photo Google faced another regulatory challenge on Monday when the authorities in Turkey opened an investigation into whether the search giant’s popular Android software had broken the country’s antitrust rules. The investigation in Turkey is the latest legal problem for Google, which faces three separate competition charges in Europe and has already been found to breach antitrust legislation in Russia. United States officials have also investigated the company over its Android and search services, but they have not brought a case. Google denies that it has broken any laws, saying that its digital services like search and online maps do not hinder those of rivals. The number of regulatory investigations worldwide represents a growing threat for the company, just as other Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Amazon increasingly challenge Google in the race to create new tech gadgets and digital services. This is not the first time that Google has faced setbacks in Turkey. Over the past few years, the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has repeatedly blocked YouTube, Google’s popular video service, and social networks — services often used by opponents of Mr. Erdogan to share their dissent.

Yandex has charged that makers of cellphones are obliged to use Google’s services if they want to use the latest version of Android, but that such obligations are unfair because they create an uneven playing field. The regulator, the Turkish Competition Authority, had initially declined to investigate Yandex’s complaint, but it said on Monday that it would look at whether Google’s use of Android to promote its other digital services infringed on the country’s competition rules. It is unclear how long the investigation will take. The inquiry mirrors one by the European authorities in which Google was charged last year with abusing its dominant position with Android to benefit its other services over those of rivals. That inquiry by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, focused on a Google requirement that some cellphone manufacturers preinstall the company’s services, including its Google Play smartphone app store. The commission also found that Google had given the companies unfair financial incentives to favor its services on their mobile devices.

Google has been under siege in Europe in the last week after reports that brands’ advertising appeared next to extremist material and other offensive content on YouTube and some of the roughly two million sites in Google’s display network. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The company has defended itself by noting that it prevents ads, which are placed on websites automatically, from running near inappropriate material “in the vast majority of cases.” It also said it added thousands of sites to its ad network every day, as well as 400 hours of video to YouTube every minute. Still, several advertisers, seeking more accountability, have pulled some of their ad spending. They include the British government, The Guardian, the pharmaceutical company GSK and the French advertising multinational Havas. Now, the issue is taking hold with American advertisers, with the car rental company Enterprise announcing a temporary halt of spending on YouTube on Wednesday. Verizon, while it did not mention Google or YouTube by name, said Wednesday that it would suspend “all digital nonsearch advertising inventory” after learning its ads “were appearing on nonsanctioned websites,” which presumably included ads on YouTube and websites in Google’s ad network. Advertisement Continue reading the main story AT&T said in its statement: “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s nonsearch platforms.” Johnson & Johnson said it “has decided to pause all YouTube digital advertising globally to ensure our product advertising does not appear on channels that promote offensive content.” The company added, “We take this matter very seriously and will continue to take every measure to ensure our brand advertising is consistent with our brand values.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Google, in response to the actions, said, “We don’t comment on individual customers, but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear.” Google has become the largest seller of advertising on the internet by pairing its vast network of content — its own and other publishers’ — with businesses large and small looking to grab eyeballs moving from traditional media to the web. The company’s ad business generated $22.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, about 85 percent of the total revenue in the period by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

As advertisers target people based on their browser history — the reason a pair of jeans in an online shopping cart may follow a person around the web for weeks — and extend their reach to all manner of websites and videos based on how many people are tuning in, they are growing more reliant on technology companies to prevent them from showing up in the wrong places. Whereas advertisers usually get strict assurances about how and where their ads will be placed on television and in print publications, Google and other internet players like Facebook do not provide the same oversight. That is because of the volume of websites they deal with, because of the fact that they have less direct control over the content uploaded to those sites and because algorithms, rather than humans, place the majority of ads. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Google’s policies prohibit ads on video content deemed to be pornographic, inciting violence or promoting illegal behavior. The company uses software to comb YouTube titles and images to flag potentially inappropriate content, but by its own admission, these methods are not perfect. Marketers also have the option of prohibiting their ads from appearing next to certain types of content, such as videos featuring profanity. “Although it is effective in dealing with the highly fragmented nature of the digital ad world, programmatic buying is still evolving as a business practice — and it appears that technology has gotten ahead of the advertising industry’s checks and balances,” Laura Bryant, a spokeswoman for Enterprise, said in a statement. “There is no doubt there are serious flaws that need to be addressed.” Programmatic advertising and YouTube represent two major initiatives for Alphabet. The shift to searches on smartphones has pushed down the prices for Google’s main search ads, heightening the importance of new areas of growth. Google does not break out revenue from either business but has trumpeted both during earnings calls. Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts in January that Google had only “scratched the surface” for what it could do with YouTube and programmatic advertising. “We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped,” she said.
